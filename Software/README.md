### SCC 
The SCC algorithm is a Sensor-based Complete Coverage path planner in which we consider that all the target are known to the robot.

> |:--|
The algorithm constructs crack graph for all the known cracks in the workspace, then it computes the MCD and Reeb Graph. The Crack graph and the Reeb graphs are merged and computes a shortest path sequence using the Chinese Postman Problem. Finally, the full coverage path is computed by the Boustrophedon Path planner.  

Run the below command in MATLAB console to execute Sensor-based Complete Coverage (SCC):
```matlab
SCC.m
```

### OnlineSCC 
The onlineSCC algorithm is a practical extension of SCC where the robot stores and incrementally constructs the crack graph online. It scans for new cracks in W and updates the crack graph while simultaneously filling it.

### Image Planning 
The first step for the Robot is to extract the cracks from an RGB image of the surface cracks. The `Image_Planning_Func.m` converts the RGB image into Binary image, then skeletonizes the cracks and traces the to extract the cracks and their metadata.

The `Image_Planning_Func.m` also computes the Minkowski Sum over the cracks extracted and then computes the `crackGraph` using the Visibility Graph algorithm.

The image planning is performed differently between onlineSCC and SCC. For SCC, the algorithm computes the image planning for the entire workspace with all crack information. For onlineSCC, the algorithm computes the image planning only for the sensor range in a loop as the robot scans and fill the cracks online. 

#### Image Planning for onlineSCC:
```matlab
function [waypoint_coords,flag,crackR,ttt] = image_planning_func_oSCC(BW3,a,s,cp,acp,endP,realEndP,contEndP,ppath,preCrack)
%
% Performs Image processing, extacts cracks and metadata, and computes the waypoints for the crackGraph using Visibility Graph.
%
% INPUTS:
%   BW3 = Binary image of the sensor range. 
%   a = Footprint Range. 
%   s = Sensor Range.
%   cp = Simulated current point.
%   acp = Actual currnt point. 
%   endP = [x0; y0] = All enpoints of the extracted cracks.
%   realEndP = [x0; y0] = Real enpoints in endP. 
%   contEndP = [x0; y0] = Continuing enpoints in endP.
%   ppath = [x0; y0] = Path of the robot from start to current iteration. 
%   preCrack = [x0; y0] = Scanned craks from previous iteration. 
%
% OUTPUTS:
%   waypoint_coords = [x0; y0] = Waypoint coordinates of the crackGraph. 
%   flag = high if robot is curently filling, low if robot is just trasversing.
%   crackR = [x0; y0] = Scanned craks from current iteration.

%

### MCD
Morce Cell Decomposition (MCD) is one of the Cellular Decomposition Methods. It is used to identify the critical points in the workspace and decompose the complex workspace into multiple simple cells. A ‚ÄòSlice‚Äô is a vertical line that is swept from left to right and connectivity changes are recorded.

> |Fig. 3. Illustration of the Morse-based cellular decomposition (MCD) with a one-edge crack graph. ùê¥<sub>ùëñ</sub> , ùê∂<sub>ùëñ</sub> and ùê∏<sub>ùëñ</sub> represent cells, nodes (i.e., critical points) and edges of the Reeb graph, respectively.|

For example, the slice line shown in the image is swept from left to right, as the slice line is swept in this region the connectivity is 1, and as it sweeps over an obstacle or a target region the line splits in to two thus the connectivity is two and then again it becomes one.

The places where the changes occur are marked as a critical point and the cells are split at those points. After performing MCD we have ùê∂<sub>*1*</sub> ‚Äì ùê∂<sub>*4*</sub>, and ùê¥<sub>*1*</sub>-ùê¥<sub>*4*</sub>

```


### Reeb

A Reeb graph represent the topology of the cellular decomposition, which is illustrated in Figure 1. with edges ùê∏<sub>*1*</sub> - ùê∏<sub>*4*</sub>. It defines the connectivity of the decomposed cells in the workspace, where the nodes represent the critical points and the edges represent their respective cells.

### ChinesePostMan
Chinese Postman Problem is a variation of Eulerian circuit problem for undirected graphs. An Euler Circuit is a closed walk that covers every edge once starting and ending position is same. Chinese Postman problem is defined for connected and undirected graph. The problem is to find shortest path or circuity that visits every edge of the graph at least once.
